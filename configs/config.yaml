  # --- General trainer config (for non-phase-specific code) ---
  - general/trainer: default      # top-level trainer for general code, this just linkes to the general/trainer/default.yaml file. only used when loop (keep in mind that this is the default loop) is overridden.

  # --- Phase 1 component configs ---
  - phase1/encoder: mlp           # encoder architecture and hyperparameters
  - phase1/decoder: mlp           # decoder architecture and hyperparameters
  - phase1/latent_space: none       # latent space configuration (VQ, none, etc.)
